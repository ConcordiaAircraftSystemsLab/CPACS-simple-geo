# CPACS Simplified Geometry Transformer

The CPACS Simplified Geometry Transformer can adjust complex CPACS geometry through proportionally scaling according to some geometrical parameter. For example, adjusting the fuselage length will rescale each section to have the same relative sizes while changing the overall fuselage length
