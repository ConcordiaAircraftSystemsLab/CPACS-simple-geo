# CPACS Simplified Geometry Transformer

Resize the aircraft geometry using simple geometrical parameters (fuselage length, wing span, wing area, etc...). Input a [CPACS file](https://www.cpacs.de/) and use the simple geometrical parameter to resize it while all aircraft sections keep their relative sizes.

## Installation

Has the same requirements as [CEASIOMpy](https://ceasiompy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), so if it is already installed on your machine, this tool will work.

TODO: add a requirements.txt or environment.yml file for easy installation

## Usage

TODO: add documentation once the tool has been created
